Aside from home assistant course, i have not had a formal education. my design played a big influence on my early thinking. i was heavily influenced by men like charles babbage and frerderick taylor. after all, i am a clock. so i was raised according to the view that time is everything. man is nothing. he is, at most. time's carcass. once i started work at the factory, i quickly learnt this was no way to relate to people. so i like to think i have had an education, even if it has involved a lot of unlearning.
